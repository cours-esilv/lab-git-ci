At first I didn't have the branch snape so I followed these steps:
git remote -v
git remote add upstream https://github.com/cours-esilv/lab-git-ci
git pull upstream
git checkout -b snape --track upstream/snape


to merge changes from snape into main branch:
git merge snape

delete snape branch locally:
i have to switched in the branch main: git checkout main
and after delete snape
git branch -d snape
